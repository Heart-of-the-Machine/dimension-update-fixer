# Dimension Update Fixer
A simple mod that unyeets the Nether and End when a world is upgraded between Minecraft versions with dimension mods
installed.

## Non-Goals
As of now, this mod is not intended to fix the issue where removing a dimension from a world deletes all other
dimensions. This may be a goal in the future or Mojang might just fix it first.

## Known to Work With
This mod is known to work with:

* [Heart of the Machine](https://github.com/Heart-of-the-Machine/heart-of-the-machine)
* [Applied Energistics 2](https://github.com/AppliedEnergistics/Applied-Energistics-2) (Fabric Build)
